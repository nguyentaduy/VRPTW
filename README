Organization of repo:
  In/: Solomon data
  Test_in/: Generated data from Solomon benchmark
  Test_in_out/: Solution of generated data (arcs information)
  Result_in_out/: Objective of solutions
  or-Solver/: containing a file which writes ortool solvers for generated data
  cplex-Solver/: containing a file which writes cplex solvers for full programs and a file which writes scripts to run on server
  Subprob-cplex-Solver/: containing a file which writes cplex solvers for reduced programs and a file which writes scripts to run on server
  Generator.ipynb: Generator of 200-customer data
  Generator-Hom.ipynb: Generator of 50-customer data
  Count.ipynb: Count frequencies of arcs and choose arcs to remove (plus clustering algo)
  Process_log.py: process log file
  Aggregate_2.py: Aggregate test results (choose solutions among 10 times run + average runtimes)
  Analysis.ipynb: Assemble and compare results
